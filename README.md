# MonoalphabeticFileEncryption
Encrypts the file using ciphers (defined in code) via substitution. 
Creates a dictionary in the format encrypted:decrypted, and then takes in data of the file and encrypts or decrypts the data. 

For the future, implement a data base so that multiple folders or files can be used for this or make a html site where people can store 
their files.
